Job Success Rate: % completed without errors. (Why it matters: Platform reliability.)
Error Count / Error Rate by Type: Number/rate of errors, broken down by type. (Why it matters: Rapid troubleshooting.)
Failed Job Instances: Count/list of failing instances. (Why it matters: Immediate drill-down.)
Alerts Triggered: Log of automated alerts. (Why it matters: Flags critical events.)

Job Success Rate:

Data Source: The status column.
Grafana Query Logic: Count status = 'SUCCESS' executions and total executions within a time range.
SELECT
    date_trunc('hour', start_time) AS time,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS success_rate
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) -- Grafana macro for time range
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;


Error Count / Error Rate by Type:

Data Source: The status, error_type, and error_message columns.
Grafana Query Logic: Filter by status = 'FAILED', count errors, and group by error_type or error_message.
SELECT
    error_type,
    COUNT(*) AS error_count
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'FAILED'
GROUP BY error_type
ORDER BY error_count DESC;

Failed Job Instances:

Data Source: The job_instance_id, status, start_time, error_message columns.
Grafana Query Logic: Filter by status = 'FAILED' and display details.
Example SQL (for a list of recent failures):

SELECT
    start_time,
    job_instance_id,
    job_name,
    error_type,
    error_message
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'FAILED'
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 20; -- For a table panel showing recent failures


For Resource Utilization & Performance Optimization:

Average Generation Time (by Schema/Volume): Time taken for requests, categorized. (Why it matters: Identifies bottlenecks.)
Max Generation Time: Longest time any single request took. (Why it matters: Highlights outliers.)
Jobs in Progress / Queued Jobs: Real-time count of active/waiting requests. (Why it matters: Understand current load.)
Data Volume Generated (Total/Per Job): Total amount of data produced. (Why it matters: Capacity planning.)

Average Generation Time (by Schema/Volume):
Data Source: duration_ms, job_name, generated_rows

Grafana Query Logic: Calculate the average duration_ms, grouped by job_name (schema) or generated_rows (volume).

Example SQL (Average Generation Time by Schema):
SELECT
    job_name AS schema_name,
    AVG(duration_ms) / 1000.0 AS avg_generation_time_sec
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'SUCCESS'
GROUP BY job_name
ORDER BY avg_generation_time_sec DESC;

Example SQL (Average Generation Time by Data Volume):
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN generated_rows < 10000 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN generated_rows < 1000000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Large'
    END AS data_volume_category,
    AVG(duration_ms) / 1000.0 AS avg_generation_time_sec
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'SUCCESS' AND generated_rows IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Max Generation Time:
Data Source: duration_ms

Grafana Query Logic: Find the maximum duration_ms within a selected time range.

Example SQL:
SELECT
    MAX(duration_ms) / 1000.0 AS max_generation_time_sec
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'SUCCESS';

Jobs in Progress / Queued Jobs:
Data Source: status

Grafana Query Logic: Count jobs with status = 'RUNNING' (in progress) and potentially a separate query to count jobs that are queued but haven't started (if your system tracks a queue). Since your table doesn't explicitly track a queue, you'd need to adapt this based on how your system indicates a "queued" job.
Example SQL (Jobs in Progress):
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS jobs_in_progress
FROM job_executions
WHERE status = 'RUNNING';

Data Volume Generated (Total/Per Job):
Data Source: generated_rows

Grafana Query Logic: Sum generated_rows for total volume, or group by job_name for per-job volume.

Example SQL (Total Data Volume):
SELECT
    SUM(generated_rows) AS total_rows_generated
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'SUCCESS';

Example SQL (Data Volume per Job Type):
SELECT
    job_name,
    SUM(generated_rows) AS total_rows_generated
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'SUCCESS' AND generated_rows IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY job_name
ORDER BY total_rows_generated DESC;

For Understanding Usage Patterns & Prioritization:

Number of Unique Users/Teams: Count of distinct users/teams. (Why it matters: Measures adoption.)
Most Frequently Requested Schemas: List/chart of most often generated schemas. (Why it matters: Guides enhancements.)
Data Generation Requests by Time/Day: Graph of request volume over time. (Why it matters: Reveals peak usage.)
Top N Users/Teams by Request Count/Volume: Ranked list of top data generators. (Why it matters: Identifies power users/support needs.)

Number of Unique Users/Teams:

Data Source: requested_by_user_id, requested_by_team_id columns.
Grafana Query Logic: Count distinct requested_by_user_id or requested_by_team_id within a given time range.
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT requested_by_user_id) AS unique_users
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time);

Most Frequently Requested Schemas:

Data Source: job_name column.
Grafana Query Logic: Count occurrences of job_name within a time range and order by count.
Example SQL:
SELECT
    job_name AS schema_name,
    COUNT(*) AS request_count
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time)
GROUP BY job_name
ORDER BY request_count DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Top 10 schemas

Data Generation Requests by Time/Day:

Data Source: start_time column.
Grafana Query Logic: Count jobs, grouped by time intervals (e.g., hour of day, day of week).
Example SQL (Hourly Request Volume):
SELECT
    date_trunc('hour', start_time) AS time,
    COUNT(*) AS requests_per_hour
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

Top N Users/Teams by Request Count/Volume:

Data Source: requested_by_user_id, requested_by_team_id, generated_rows (for volume).
Grafana Query Logic: Group by user/team, sum generated_rows or count executions, and order.
Example SQL (Top 5 Teams by Request Count):
SELECT
    requested_by_team_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_requests
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time)
GROUP BY requested_by_team_id
ORDER BY total_requests DESC
LIMIT 5;

Example SQL (Top 5 Users by Generated Volume):
SELECT
    requested_by_user_id,
    SUM(generated_rows) AS total_rows_generated
FROM job_executions
WHERE $__timeFilter(start_time) AND status = 'SUCCESS' -- Only count successful generations
GROUP BY requested_by_user_id
ORDER BY total_rows_generated DESC
LIMIT 5;
